<h2 id="bonjour">Bonjour</h2>

<p>You signed up for the Realtime Conference and we are happy to welcome you in Lyon, a beautiful and fun city to explore!
My name is Flavie and I’m a <a href="http://visites-de-flavie.com/">tour guide in Lyon</a>. You will find here some tips to guide you from your arrival in France's second largest city. I hope you enjoy what the city can offer to you and your families.</p>

<h2 id="your-arrival">Your arrival</h2>

<h3 id="by-plane">By Plane</h3>

<p>Bravo! You arrived at <a href="http://www.lyonaeroports.com/">Lyon Airport</a> named <em>Saint Exupery</em> (after the <em>Little Prince</em> writer, who was born in Lyon). The easiest way to reach the city center is to take the <strong><a href="http://www.rhonexpress.fr/">Rhone Express</a></strong> a new red tram. It is very easy to find (follow the signs in red and white <em>Rhone Express</em>) and fast (30 min from the airport to the last stop <em>Lyon Part-Dieu</em>: the train station in the heart of the city). It runs every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>You have plenty of infos of the website (and in english) and you can even buy your tickets in advance online. There is a vending machine before the access to the platform (under the huge hall covered by glass) but no worries if you miss it as you can always buy your tickets on board for an additional 1€ and payment can be made by credit card and in cash (€uros). If you are leaving Lyon by plane as well you can buy the return ticket at the same time.</p>

<p>The last stop is the train station <em>Lyon Part-Dieu</em> and from that point you will have access to metro (underground), tram (lightrails), bus and taxis to reach you final destination. </p>

<p>You could also take a taxi from the airport itself, but plan on a 50 to 70€ rate depending on the time of the day.</p>

<p>Our local transportation system is called <strong><a href="http://www.tcl.fr/en">TCL</a></strong> and its website has a trip planner.</p>

<h3 id="by-train">By Train</h3>

<p><em>Be careful</em>: we have 2 train stations in the center of Lyon: <em>Part-Dieu</em> and <em>Perrache</em>. Please double check you train tickets and get off at the right station!</p>

<p>Most of the trains will arrive at Lyon Part-Dieu though as it is the biggest station but if you have the choice just double check your hotel/accomodation area to choose which station will be more interesting for you.</p>

<p>Anyway, you will find lots of public transportation options to reach your final destination. Our local transportation system is called <strong><a href="http://www.tcl.fr/en">TCL</a></strong> and its website has a trip planner.</p>

<h2 id="getting-around">Getting Around</h2>

<h3 id="public-transportation">Public transportation</h3>

<p>Reminder: our local transportation system is called <strong><a href="http://www.tcl.fr/en">TCL</a></strong> and its website has a trip planner.</p>

<p>This system is pretty easy to use, just follow the maps at all stations! Tickets can be bought at vending machines in all metro stations and at some bus/tram stations.</p>

<p>Here are our main tips to enjoy using public transportation:</p>

<ul class="guidelines">
<li>Calculate your route before leaving, especially the first time you’ll travel in the city! </li>
<li>A single Tickets cost 1.70€  but by set of 10, only 1.40€! Many fares for many options...</li>
<li>Always have a ticket before boarding the bus: a ticket  will cost you 2€ if you ask one to the driver so spare your change!</li>
<li>Walk or take the Velov’ (see further) if you are staying in the city center. Lyon has a pretty small center and you won’t be here everyday so enjoy what you will see!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="walking">Walking</h3>

<p>Yes we know you don’t need any tips to walk in the city but just to encourage you again to walk in this gorgeous city! People are helpful, don’t hesitate to ask your way.
It's also safe at any time, so don't be shy.</p>

<h3 id="velov">Velo'v</h3>

<p>An easy option to go further or as an activity by itself, you have to try the city’s bikesharing system : the <a href="http://www.velov.grandlyon.com/">Velo’v</a> (Velo means Bike in french!)</p>

<p>The 340 Velo’v stations are spread everywhere in the city and clearly visible with their red and white signs and their set of bikes.</p>

<p>How it works is very easy: just buy a short-term ticket. You can then ride bikes for free as long as it’s less than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>You can buy a 1day-ticket online or at each velo’v station for just 1.50 euros!</p>

<h2 id="hotels-and-accomodation">Hotels and Accomodation</h2>

<p><em>Before booking anything</em>:</p>

<ul class="guidelines">
<li>Make sure you are in a central neighborhood! Identify clearly the Conference Location: at <a href="http://www.la-plateforme.fr/">la Plateforme</a>. It's a boat on the Rhone River. (Be careful: Lyon has 2 rivers, and yes the map above is accurate)</li>
<li>Lyon’s center is the peninsula right between the 2 rivers (called Presqu’ile) and where you will find the closest and more convenient options for your accomodation.</li>
<li>Don’t expect to have wifi in all hotels in France so double-check the internet conditions before confirming anything!</li>
<li>Don’t be surprised: most prices won't include the daily <em>tourist tax</em>. Expect to have an additionnal small amount in euros (around 2 euros per night) on your invoice. The VAT is, usually already included.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hotels">Hotels</h3>

<p>The hotel we have selected for the speakers is <a href="http://www.mercure.com/fr/hotel-2057-mercure-lyon-centre-saxe-lafayette/index.shtml">The Mercure Lyon centre - Saxe Lafayette</a>. It is located less than 10 min walking distance from the conference venue and 15 min from the <em>Gare Part-Dieu</em> (the final stop of the Rhone express- the tram coming from the airport). If you want to avoid walking on arrival, you can take the bus (C9 or C13 and get off at  <em>saxe-prefecture</em>) or the subway (métro) (B line, get off at <em>Guichard</em>) or the lightrail (tram) T1 (get off at <em>Palais de justice</em>).</p>

<p>You can find more options <a href="http://book.lyon-france.com/en/accommodation">on this <em>ugly</em>  page</a> which offers a good range of options in Lyon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Special Tiny Budget!
  Another option if you want to spend more money on food and wine than on accomodation, is to go to Hotel Central. It is further to reach the Conference venue : 30 min walking or 20 min by tram and is located a bit further than the city center, but it’s a cheap option.
  Prices will be 79€ for a room for 1 person (including breakfast) and 87€ for a room for 2 person (including breakfast). These prices are guaranteed until end of March so hurry up!
  If you are interested please send an email to  info@hotel-central.fr and mention the fact you are part of the conference “Realtime”. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="airbnb">Airbnb</h3>

<p>You can always try <a href="https://www.airbnb.fr/s/Lyon--France">Airbnb</a> to find some good deals, but please, make sure it's conveniently located!</p>

<h2 id="restaurants">Restaurants</h2>

<p>Lyon is a great city to discover the french gastronomy and part of the reputation of our city!  Here is a list of a few restaurants you can go eyes closed and trust us:</p>

<ul class="guidelines">
<li><em>Chez Abel</em> 25 Rue Guynemer 69002 Lyon - 04 78 37 46 18

<li><em>Brasserie BOCUSE “le Sud”</em> - 11 Place Antonin Poncet 69002 Lyon - 04 72 77 80 00
One of the 5 Bocuse Brasseries in Lyon. Called “le Sud” (“the South”) because its cuisine is inspired from the mediterranean classics revisited by the Nouvelle cuisine of Bocuse.

</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-do-in-lyon">What to do in Lyon</h2>

<p>Lyon is a great city to explore: the city center itself is not that big so even if you are here for a few days you will have time to do plenty! Here is a list by order of interest of the different neighborhoods you should explore during your stay:</p>

<ul class="guidelines">
<li><strong>The Vieux Lyon with the Cathedral</strong>, the old cobblestones streets, the lively athmosphere adn the traboules: mysterious passageways that only locals know (pr anyone with a map, ask us!). With kids (or without!), don’t miss the astronomical clock- running every day at 12:00PM, 2:00PM, 3:00PM and 4:00PM in the ‘<em>cathedrale Saint Jean</em>’. It is free, runnning every day, you just need to enter the church and go the rear on the left on those timings!</li>
<li><strong>the Fourviere Hill</strong> for the gorgeous overview of Lyon from the top, the <em>Basilica</em> and the <em>roman ruins</em> on the slopes of the hill. A nice way to go to the top of this hill is to take the funicular while you can walk down through the roman ruins or the gardens.</li>
<li>the <strong>City center</strong> with the shopping streets, the nice buildings (<em>Opéra</em>, <em>Fine arts museum</em>, <em>City Hall</em>...) and its squares.</li>
<li>the <strong>Croix Rousse</strong> Hill and its hidden passageways and its silk industry past...</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-the-foodies-but-not-only">For the Foodies (but not only...)</h3>

<p>You have to go to the covered market "<a href="http://www.hallespaulbocuse.lyon.fr/">Les Halles de Lyon</a>". It is a great place to discover and taste the greatest food of the area: that is where some chefs (like Bocuse in his time) were getting their food supplies for their cooking. You can even have lunch there... from fresh oysters to cheese degustation... and also a place you find gift for your foody friends! It's closed on sunday afternoons and on mondays, though.</p>

<h3 id="for-art-and-history-lovers-or-in-case-of-heavy-rain">For art and history lovers (or in case of heavy rain...)</h3>

<ul class="guidelines">
<li>The <a href="http://www.mba-lyon.fr/mba/">Musée des Beaux Arts de Lyon</a> is a great one if you are into fine arts, paintings and scuptures. </li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.musees-gallo-romains.com/">Musée Gallo-romain</a> next to this famous ruins is great if you are into Archaelogy.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.institut-lumiere.org/">Lumière Institute</a>: the museum dedicated to Lumière Brothers who are the first film makers... the “pre-hollywood”!</li>
<li>With kids, you can try the  <a href="http://www.museeminiatureetcinema.fr/accueil.html">Miniature museum</a> in the heart of the Vieux Lyon. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-walkers-runners-fitbit-owners-and-for-kids">For walkers, runners, fitbit owners and for kids.</h3>

<ul class="guidelines">
<li>We have a great park with a free zoo in the city: the <a href="http://www.loisirs-parcdelatetedor.com/">Parc de la Tete d'or</a>. A great place to enjoy a breath of fresh air!</li>
<li>Along the Rhone River the banks have been organized to offer a nice walk from the Cité Internationale to the north, to the South of Lyon. You can use the local bike renting system (Velo'v, see above) to enjoy even more! You have some playgrounds along the river as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reminder-specially-for-first-timers-in-france">Reminder (specially for first timers in France!)</h2>

<h3 id="money">Money</h3>

<p>Taxes are included in the prices you will see in the shops. At restaurants, tips are already included- our custom is to leave a little change if you were happy with the service (the change for just a drink, 1 or 2 euros for a quick seated lunch, a bit more for nice dinner and depending on the bill) but there is <em>NO OBLIGATION</em>. </p>

<h3 id="attitude">Attitude</h3>

<p>Despite living in an incredible country, the French are a bit grumpy... I have no explanation for that- just don’t be surprise if the person in front of you is not smiling... it is not against you, it is just the way we are! </p>

<h3 id="restaurants-2">Restaurants</h3>

<p>We love to spend time in restaurants... you might feel that the service is very slow -keep in mind we love to talk around a meal... and we talk generally about food :-) Don't forget to ask for the check at the end because if you are waiting  for it you might wait forever. It is considered rude here if the waiter is bringing too quickly the bill! So say: “l’addition s’il vous plait” and you will get it!</p>

<h2 id="enjoy">Enjoy!</h2>

<p>If you have any questions related to Lyon and your stay in the city, feel free to send me an email at flavie.thomas@gmail.com. I am currently 8 months pregnant and pretty slow so I might not answer in the next hour after receiving your email but I will do my best! </p>

<p>A très bientôt!</p>
